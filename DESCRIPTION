Description: This package implements a Bayesian model to infer RNA velocity based on single-cell RNA
    sequencing data. The method considers a time-dependent transcription rate and non-trivial initial
    conditions, generalizing the state-of-the-art dynamic model. Further, a post-processing step is 
    performed to estimate a unified gene-shared latent time for each cell, using posterior summaries 
    from independent fit of the genes.
