# ConsensusVelo

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ConsensusVelo is to estimate RNA velocity with sound uncertainty quantification in a Bayesian manner. The method consists of fitting individual genes based on the unspliced and spliced counts, assuming a time-dependent transcription rate and non-trial initial conditions. A post-processing step is also provided to combine information across genes and estimate a gene-shared latent time, which facilitaes interpretation of cell temporal orders with uncertainty.

A full demo for how to use the R package is provided in here.

You can install the development version of chdp from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("huizizhang949/ConsensusVelo")
```
